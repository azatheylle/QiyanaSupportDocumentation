## Rune Setups

### Main Runes

**Electrocute**
- **Best Against:** Enchanters (Lulu, Janna, Soraka, etc.)
- **Why:** Provides burst damage to quickly eliminate squishy enchanter supports
- **Usage:** Ideal for aggressive trades and all-ins against low-health targets

**Conqueror** 
- **Best Against:** Tank supports (Leona, Nautilus, Thresh, etc.)
- **Why:** Sustained damage and healing for extended fights against tankier opponents
- **Usage:** Better for longer trades where you can stack the rune effectively

### Secondary Trees

**Resolve (Recommended with Conqueror)**
- Provides additional survivability
- Good synergy with extended fights where Conqueror excels
- Helps survive engage from tank supports
