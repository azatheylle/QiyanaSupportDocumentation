## Rune Setups

### Main Runes

**Electrocute**
- **Best Against:** Enchanters (Lulu, Janna, Soraka, etc.)
- **Why:** Provides burst damage to quickly eliminate squishy enchanter supports
- **Usage:** Ideal for aggressive trades and all-ins against low-health targets

**Conqueror** 
- **Best Against:** Tank supports (Leona, Nautilus, Thresh, etc.)
- **Why:** Sustained damage and healing for extended fights against tankier opponents
- **Usage:** Better for longer trades where you can stack the rune effectively

### Secondary Trees

**Inspiration**
- Provides additional damage
- Provides extra mana for lanes with a lot of potential poking

**Resolve (Recommended with Conqueror)**
- Provides additional survivability
- Good synergy with extended fights where Conqueror excels
- Helps survive engage from tank supports

**Resolve (Situational with Electrocute)**
- Consider taking Resolve secondary even with Electrocute against heavy poke lanes
- Particularly useful against champions like Caitlyn when combined with strong poke supports
- Provides early game survivability at the cost of some damage potential

## General Tips

*Essential gameplay techniques applicable in every match*

### Combat Techniques

**E-F Flash Combo**
- Use E-F (E followed immediately by Flash) to execute combos faster
- This technique allows for quicker gap closing and harder-to-react-to engages
- Particularly effective for surprising opponents with instant burst damage

**Q-W Wall Traversal**
- Always use Q-W combination when crossing over walls instead of just using W alone
- This technique provides better positioning and maintains your Q ability for follow-up damage
- More efficient for both escape and engage scenarios

### Teamfight Positioning

**River Fight Ultimate Strategy**
- In river fights, instead of ulting targets directly into walls, aim to ult them into the middle of the fight
- This positioning allows your team to easily follow up and finish the target
- The target still gets stunned while potentially catching more enemies in the area effect
- Maximizes team coordination and increases overall teamfight impact

## Notes

- Always confirm contradictory information before making changes
- W/L records will be maintained for each champion matchup (winning versus or with a champion means putting 1-0 under it, and so losing with or against means putting 0-1 under it)
- Documentation will be continuously updated based on gameplay experience
